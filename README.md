## 🛠️ How It Works

- Uses `setInterval()` to update the timer every second
- Lap times are added dynamically using JavaScript DOM methods
- Lap section is scrollable to avoid layout overflow
- The Resume button continues timer after pause without resetting

---

## 🧪 Learning Outcomes

- Improved understanding of JavaScript timing functions
- Built a complete project using event-driven programming
- Practiced CSS layout techniques and mobile responsiveness
- Applied DOM manipulation and dynamic content rendering
